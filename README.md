# What is License
A license refers to a legal agreement that determines how a repository's code can be used and distributed by others. When you create a new repository on GitHub, you have the option to choose a license for your code.
There are several types of licenses available, each with its own terms and conditions. Some licenses allow anyone to use and modify the code, while others restrict the use and distribution of the code.
Choosing a license for your GitHub repository is important because it can help protect your intellectual property rights and clarify how others can use your code. Additionally, many open source projects require a specific license to participate in the project, so choosing the right license can also help attract contributors to your project.
GitHub provides a license chooser tool that can help you select a license based on your project's needs. It's important to review and understand the terms of the license you choose, as it will determine how your code can be used and distributed by others.

#2. BSD
BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) is a family of permissive free software licenses that are commonly used for open source software projects, including those hosted on GitHub. These licenses are named after the University of California, Berkeley, where the first version of the BSD operating system was developed.
The BSD licenses are permissive in that they allow users to modify and redistribute the software, even for commercial purposes, with few restrictions. There are several variants of the BSD license, but they all share this permissive approach to licensing.
The original BSD license, also known as the 4-clause BSD license, included a clause requiring acknowledgement of the University of California, Berkeley as a contributor to the software. However, this clause was later removed in the 3-clause BSD license, which is now the most commonly used variant of the BSD license.
The 3-clause BSD license includes the following three clauses:
1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
3. Neither the name of the [organization] nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
4. #3. APACHE
5. The Apache License is a permissive open source software license that is commonly used for projects hosted on GitHub. It is named after the Apache Software Foundation, which created and maintains the license.
The Apache License is similar to other permissive licenses, such as the MIT and BSD licenses, in that it allows users to use, modify, and distribute the code, even for commercial purposes, with few restrictions. However, it also includes a patent grant, which provides additional protection against patent litigation for users of the software.
The Apache License has two versions: version 1.0 and version 2.0. Version 2.0 is the most commonly used version and includes the following three main clauses:
1.Grant of Copyright License: This clause grants users a license to use, modify, and distribute the code, subject to the conditions of the license.
2.Grant of Patent License: This clause grants users a license to any patents that are held by the copyright holder that cover the code, subject to the conditions of the license.
3.Disclaimer of Warranty and Limitation of Liability: This clause disclaims any warranties for the software and limits the liability of the copyright holder for damages arising from the use of the software.
